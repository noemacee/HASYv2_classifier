# HASYv2_classifier
The project is a reupload of a project done in between March 2023 - June 2023.

This paper details our approach to classifying handwritten mathematical symbols using a range of machine learning techniques. We implemented and assessed various machine learning methods using a carefully selected subset of the HASYv2 dataset, which comprises 32x32 images of hand-drawn mathematical symbols.

To achieve symbol classification, we employed a variety of techniques:
#### K-Means Clustering 
#### Logistic Regression
#### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
#### Multi-Layer Perception (MLP)
#### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
